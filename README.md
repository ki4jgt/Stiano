# Play Like a Master Musician With Minimal Effort
## Glide from one octave to the next at the touch of a button!

Stiano is an open source synthesizer which uses the ergonomic design of stenotype to help you effortlessly create music!
Stiano is designed to keep your 10 fingers at homerow, while offering you a full 4 scale (48 keys) layout. If you can
type, you can play music with Stiano.

As a kid, I always wanted to play the piano. And though quite a few people were willing to tutor me, I could never manage
to get to my lessons. Then my room started filling up with junk, and my free space got smaller and smaller. No space for
a keyboard now!

Recently working as a professional stenographer, my dreams of becoming a master pianist had been placed on indefinite hold. . .

Until I found myself overworked, exhausted, and in desperate need of a creative outlet. But my home was just as cluttered
as ever. I still didn't have any room for a keyboard. In a bout of frustration, I hobbled together two of things I was most
passionate about: stenotype and piano.

## Positioning

Stenotype uses a combination of finger positioning, shorthand, and short finger traveling to acheive typing speeds of ~300WPM.
The benefits of transposing the piano to such a system are grossly apparent. There is a slight variance between stenotyping and
normal typing though. Stenowriters place their fingers in the cracks between the homerow, and the next row up. And your thumbs
should be located between the C,V and N,M keys. This position allows for better range of motion, easier access, and the
possibility to press any combination of active keys you may need.

## Layout

Stiano's layout is quite simple to master: The Keyboard is split into two scales: The Left Scale, and The Right Scale. Each
scale contains both C-Major and D-Minor (keys placed side-by-side for easier access).

C-Major Left: WER (CEG)
D-Minor Left: SDF (DFA)

C-Major Right: JKL (CEG)
D-Minor Right: IOP (DFA)

Both scales begin with B, and end with A. In order:

**B**
Left: A
Right: U

**C**
Left: W
Right: J

**D**
Left: S
Right: I

**E**
Left: E
Right: K

**F**
Left: D
Right: O

**G**
Left: R
Right: L

**A**
Left: F
Right: P

### Sharps

The sharp keys are also divided by hand, and are located on the number row. Each hand starts with A, respectively.

**A#**
Left: 1
Right: 6

**C#**
Left: 2
Right: 7

**D#**
Left: 3
Right: 8

**F#**
Left: 4
Right: 9

**G#**
Left: 5
Right: 0

### Accessing other scales

Remember when I told you to keep your thumbs between C, V and N, M?

- C takes your left hand down a scale.
- V takes your left hand up a scale.

- N takes your right hand down a scale.
- M takes your right hand up a scale.

### Turning Pages

My ultimate goal with Stiano is to display sheet music onscreen. Q and ; are reserved exclusively for page turning.

Enjoy Stiano!

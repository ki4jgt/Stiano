# Stiano
Stiano is a pet project which crosses two of my favorite interests: Piano, and Stenography. Stenography is the use of writing to accomplish speeds of over 200 WPM. It's used almost exclusively in dictation and transcription.

The ergonomic design of the steno machine layout, makes pefect sense to transpose a piano to any regular keyboard layout. This layout allows for greater efficiency, and speed, even over that of an old-fashioned piano layout. With the Stiano layout, there is no moving your hands to where they should be. Your hands are exactly where they need to be at all times, leaving your fingers free to press the keys you need.

## Usage

Stiano requires a couple of things:
- An NKRO keyboard
- The layout only works on QWERTY at the moment

## Positioning

Stenography machines achieve their speed partially due to finger positioning. Instead of placing your fingers on the home row, they should be placed over the cracks between the home row, and the row above it. This allows you to jam down any combination of keys, and allows your fingers to be closer to the keys you need.

Your thumbs should be resting between the M and N keys, and the C and V keys.

## Layout

The Steno layout takes a bit of getting used to. It is not linear, in the sense of a normal piano, it starts with A, wraps around to W, drops to S, then wraps around to E, drops to D, wraps to R, and drops to F for the left hand.

A = B2
W = C3
S = D3
E = E3
D = F3
R = G3
F = A3

Because your fingers are resting in the cracks of these keys, you will find yourself capable of playing any combination of them you desire.

The right hand starts with U, and ends with P.

U = B3
J = C4
I = D4
K = E4
O = F4
L = G4
P = A4

### Control Keys

Future plans are to include the ability to switch scales, and display sheet music on your Stiano screen.

The C,V and N,M keys are reserved for scales. The key to the left takes the corresponding hand down an octave, while the key to the right takes it up an octave. (not yet working)

The Q and ; keys are reserved for flipping sheet music pages. Again, your fingers are in the cracks of all of these keys. All of them are within easy reach. (not yet working)

I also plan to work flats and sharps into the layout as well.

Enjoy the keyboard!
